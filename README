amidiauto
=========

amidiauto is a program that monitors for available MIDI devices and
automatically connect appropriate inputs to outputs. For example, if
you could run a sound synthesizer and plug in a MIDI keyboard the two
will be automatically connected, allowing you to instantly control the
synthesizer with the keyboard.
